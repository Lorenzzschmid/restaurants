# Restaurants 🧆

In this assignment you will be expected to write an API for connecting to a restaurant database. You will be working with some basic mongoose querying methods.

## What you will be doing

For this assignment you will have to:

1. Load a sample dataset
2. Create a schema for the dataset collection `restaurants`
3. Create an API which is divided between 2 routes - `search` and `update`

## Tasks

Before starting these tasks, run the command `npm install` or `npm i`

### Task 1 - Loading the sample data

Before we can begin, we will load a sample dataset to work with.

MongoDB provides multiple sample datasets, with sample data for us.

1. Log into your MongoDB account
2. Follow the [instructions](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/sample-data/) on how to load the sample dataset

> Note: It may take up to 15 minutes for the dataset to completely load

After this, you should have some new databases / collections:

> sample_airbnb
> sample_analytics
> sample_geospatial
> sample_mflix
> sample_restaurants
> sample_supplies
> sample_training
> sample_weatherdata

We will be using the `sample_restaurants` database.

### Task 2 - Setting up the .env file

1. Using the `.env.example` file as a template, create a `.env` file

2. Add your database connection details to your `.env` file, filling in the details as provided to you by MongoDB
   > Hint: The key `DB_NAME` points to the name of the database you want to connect to. Use the name `sample_restaurants`. This will ensure that Mongoose will try and use the existing sample dataset you previously set up

   > Hint: The key `DB_HOST` is the **domain** of your MongoDB connection string

### Task 3 - Connecting your server to your database

1. Using the `mongoose.connect()` method, setup the connection to your server inside `server.js`
   > Hint: The connection string has already been prepared for you as the variable `dbConnectionString`
2. `mongoose.connect()` returns a promise
   - use the `then()` method to display a message saying the connection was successful
   - use the `catch()` method to display a message saying the connection failed
3. Check that your database can connect

### Task 4 - Preparing our server to receive requests

In the next tasks, we will create a REST API so that clients can connect and perform actions on our server. To do this, we must first begin with a few steps:

1. Install the npm package `cors`
2. Import and add `cors` to your middleware stack. This will prevent the dreaded same origin policy error in your browser.

> Remember to run your middleware before any of your routes!

3. Run `express.json()` as middleware. This will allow any JSON sent for example, with a POST request, to be correctly read by the server.

### Task 5 - Restaurants Schema & Model

Unfortunately the sample datasets do not come with Models or Schemas, so we must build our own to interact with these databases / collections

1. Using the MongoDB viewing tool (or another similar tool), examine the data in the `restaurants` collection. What MongoDB data types are being used?
2. Create a folder `models`
3. In this folder, create a `restaurantSchema` schema for the collection `restaurants`
4. Create a model `Restaurant` for your schema `restaurantSchema`

> Hint: You may use `String`, `Date`, `Number`, `Boolean` as your data types

> Hint: For some data you may need to use subdocuments, or an array of subdocuments

### Task 6 - Creating a search route

1. Create a `search` router which will handle all requests to the path `/search`

### Task 7 - Endpoint to search for restaurants by id

We will create an endpoint to load specific restaurant data, based on the restaurant `id`

1. Create an endpoint with the path `/id` in your `search` router. This will be a `GET` endpoint. The endpoint should expect a parameter, the restaurant `id`.

> Hint: You can access parameters from the **request** object with the `params` property

1. Import and use your `Restaurant` model to find the restaurant by `id`, then:
   - Use the `lean()` method to remove all inherited Model methods 
   - If found, return a status of `200` and the resulting restaurant
   - If not found, return a status of `404` and an appropriate message
   
> Hint: You can use the method `findById()`

### Task 8 - Endpoint to search for restaurants by name

We will create an endpoint to search for restaurant data, by name

1. Create an endpoint `/name` in your `search` router. This will be a `GET` endpoint
    - The endpoint should expect a **parameter**, the restaurant `name` to search by
    - The endpoint should expect a **query parameter**, the number of results to limit to search to

> Hint: You can access parameters from the **request** object with the `params` property

2. Use your `Restaurant` model to find the restaurant by searching in the `name` field. It should:
    - Limit the results using the `limit()` method. If no value is supplied, default to `10`
    - Use the `lean()` method to remove all inherited Model methods
    - If found, return a status of `200` and the resulting restaurants
    - If not found, return a status of `404` and an appropriate message

> Hint: Here you must use the `find()` method

### Task 9 - Creating an update route

1. Create an `update` router which will handle all requests to the path `/update`

### Task 10 - Endpoint to search and update the restaurant name restaurant by id

We will create an endpoint to update the **name** of the restaurant, based on the restaurant `id`

1. Create an endpoint `/name` in your `update` router. This will be a `PATCH` endpoint.
   - The endpoint should expect a parameter, the restaurant `id`

> Hint: You can access parameters from the **request** object with the `params` property

   - The endpoint should also expect a JSON object with details to update the restaurant document
   - Only update the following field:
     - **name**

> Hint: You can access the request body from the **request** object with the `body` property

2. Use your `Restaurant` model to find the restaurant by `id`, then:
   - If found, return a status of `200` and the resulting restaurant
   - If not found, return a status of `404` and an appropriate message

> Hint: You can use the method `findByIdAndUpdate()`

### Task 11 - Endpoint to search and update the restaurant cuisine by id

We will create an endpoint to update the **cuisine** of the restaurant, based on the restaurant `id`

1. Create an endpoint `/cuisine` in your `update` router. This will be a `PATCH` endpoint.
   - The endpoint should expect a parameter, the restaurant `id`

> Hint: You can access parameters from the **request** object with the `params` property

- The endpoint should also expect a JSON object with details to update the restaurant document
- Only update the following field:
   - **cuisine**

> Hint: You can access the request body from the **request** object with the `body` property

2. Use your `Restaurant` model to find the restaurant by `id`, then:
   - If found, return a status of `200` and the resulting updated comment text
   - If not found, return a status of `404` and an appropriate message

> Hint: You can use the method `findByIdAndUpdate()`

### Task 12 - Endpoint to search and update the restaurant location by id

We will create an endpoint to update the **address** and **borough** of the restaurant, based on the restaurant `id`

1. Create an endpoint `/location` in your `update` router. This will be a `PATCH` endpoint.
   - The endpoint should expect a parameter, the restaurant `id`

> Hint: You can access parameters from the **request** object with the `params` property

- The endpoint should also expect a JSON object with details to update the restaurant document
- Only update the following fields:
   - **address**
   - **borough**

> Hint: You can access the request body from the **request** object with the `body` property

2. Use your `Restaurant` model to find the restaurant by `id`, then:
   - If found, return a status of `200` and the resulting updated comment text
   - If not found, return a status of `404` and an appropriate message

> Hint: You can use the method `findByIdAndUpdate()`

### Task 13 - Endpoint to search and update the restaurant grades by id

We will create an endpoint to update the **grades** of the restaurant, based on the restaurant `id`

1. Create an endpoint `/grades` in your `update` router. This will be a `PATCH` endpoint.
   - The endpoint should expect a parameter, the restaurant `id`

> Hint: You can access parameters from the **request** object with the `params` property

- The endpoint should also expect a JSON object with details to update the restaurant document
- Only update the following fields:
   - **grade**

> Hint: You can access the request body from the **request** object with the `body` property

2. Use your `Restaurant` model to find the restaurant by `id`, then:
   - If found, return a status of `200` and the resulting updated comment text
   - If not found, return a status of `404` and an appropriate message

> Hint: You can use the method `findByIdAndUpdate()`

### Task 14 - Endpoint to search and delete restaurants by id

We will create an endpoint to search for and delete a restaurant based on the restaurant `id`

1. Create an endpoint `/delete` in your `restaurants` router. This will be a `DELETE` endpoint. The endpoint should expect a parameter, the restaurant `id`.

2. Use your `Restaurant` model to find the restaurant by `id`, then:
   - If found, return a status of `200` and an appropriate message
   - If not found, return a status of `404` and an appropriate message
   
> Hint: You can use the method `findByIdAndDelete()`
